The following paragraphs summarises how features in our program adhere to the Principle of Universal Design. 

Principle 1: Equitable Use

The TravelAdvisor provides activity recommendations based on user-selected interests, benefiting all users equally. The activity suggestions are based solely on personal preferences in our profile creating feature, and our interest-selecting feature allows the users to enter any interest they may have, ensuring a diverse group of users can interact equitably. The profile creation and sign-up processes are identical for all users, fostering an equal and inclusive experience. 

Principle 2: Flexibility in Use

Users can save places they are interested in and access them later, providing flexibility in how they interact with the app. The save places feature allows users to add different types of information, such as reviews and ratings, based on their preferences. Additionally, the interest-selection feature offers flexibility similar to a Google search, allowing users to input any interest they have.

Principle 3: Simple and Intuitive Use

The user interface follows a straightforward flow—users create a profile, select preferences, and receive personalized recommendations. Clear labels for text fields and buttons make the interface intuitive and easy to use. The platform delivers the intended service efficiently, without requiring extensive effort or comprehension from the user.

Principle 4: Perceptible Information

We use JSwing to present views, combining both textual and visual elements to enhance information accessibility. Labels, buttons, and other interface components are clearly labeled across all views, ensuring that users can easily perceive and understand the information and actions available.

Principle 5: Tolerance in Error 

Error messages are displayed if, for instance, users try to create a profile with a username that already exists. This helps users easily identify and correct their mistakes.

Principle 6: Low Physical Effort 

All elements of the user interface are designed to be simple to use and minimize repetitive actions. Users can navigate through different views intuitively, with large buttons and clear text fields. Features like the "New Search" button allow users to return to the search view directly after seeing suggested locations, reducing unnecessary steps and physical effort.

Principle 7: Size and Space for Approach and Use

All views in the TravelAdvisor provide a clean and well-organized layout, with adequate spacing between buttons and text fields, ensuring ease of interaction without feeling cramped. A future development goal is to integrate user accessibility tools, such as text-to-speech, to further enhance accessibility for all users.

Our program is designed to be used by anyone interested in exploring new places or discovering interesting parts of their city. Our primary target audience for marketing would be frequent travelers, as they are more likely to be dissatisfied with generic interest recommendations found on platforms like Google Maps and would appreciate a more personalized experience. Another potential target audience could be local explorers—people who enjoy uncovering hidden gems within their own city. These users may be looking for unique recommendations that go beyond the popular tourist spots, tailored specifically to their personal interests. Additionally, our program could appeal to individuals who have specific niche hobbies, such as vinyl lovers seeking second-hand record stores, or history enthusiasts searching for lesser-known historical sites.

When considering the medical model of disability, one demographic that is less likely to use our program would be individuals with visual impairment. In our program, individuals with visual impairments may face challenges since all features currently rely on visual cues, such as reading labels, navigating buttons, and being redirected to external pages. This reliance on visual interaction presents a significant barrier for visually impaired users, who might find it difficult or even impossible to use the program without external assistance.
