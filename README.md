Travel Advisors is a personalized travel planner designed to enhance your travel experience. Users can create profiles, specify their interests, and receive curated recommendations for places to visit based on their preferences. This app helps you plan your adventures with features like mapping locations, rating visited places, and scheduling activities on a calendar. This project was created as part of our CSC207 course, highlighting the usage of Clean Architecture in software design.

## Installation Instructions
To set up and run Travel Advisors locally, you must install Java and a JVM to compile and run the program. Installing an IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA is recommended to run the program. 

## Usage

When youâ€™ve downloaded Travel Advisors, launch the application and run it in your terminal or IDE. Once launched, sign up by creating a username and password. List up to five fundamental interests and a city of choice and receive a curated list of suggested locations. Before searching, you can filter the list to remove disliked and previously saved locations. Select a few suggestions that interest you, and click the associated button to open it in Google Maps. You can then place your activities in a calendar to create your ideal timetable. Once you have visited a location, you can leave a personalized note and rating for it. The selected locations will be saved to your profile for future reference.
